1.0:   INS401 upgrade function
	1. rtk/ins write cmd hasn't check self.
	2. sdk enter bootloader will fail at sometime.(each command is checked for its return).
	3. the IMU upgrade failed to return the command
	

1.0.1: Fixed some bugs in version 1.0, and optimized the program.  
	1. Shorten the upgrade time.
	2. Add read function in Ethernet communication module to prepare for data communication.  
	3. Modified the operation logic of the read until function.	


1.0.2: INS401 Firmware versions:
	1. The bootloader needs to be modified from 115200 to 230400 when sdK9100 is upgraded before 28.02.03.  
	2. No change is required after 28.02.03.
	Currently the distinction is made by manually entering input values before the program runs.  (It will be changed to automatic discrimination in the future)  


1.0.3: New function:
	1. IMU_boot upgrade supported
	2. Automatically identify all identifier bits in the firmware and upgrade each part in sequence
    	BUG fixed:
	1. SDK still in bootloader after upgrade
	2. Upgrade command self-check failed, but program still continue run


1.0.4: Fixed some bugs:
	1. After upgrade New FW(>28.02.03) SDK may not work
	2. Sometimes IMU can not jump to bootloader
        Optimized the program:
		1. Optimized redundant threads in the program


1.0.5: Optimized the program
	1. Added the function to automatically determine whether the SDK baud rate changes during the upgrade(for 1.0.2)  
	2. The output mode of the information is optimized, and different colors are used to distinguish the information of different nature
	3. The structure of some programs was adjusted


1.0.6: New function:
	1. Catch the version of RTK/INS APP on all firmware(before 28.03.11 the lens of device info is 8, after is 11)
		Fixed bugs:
	1. Command response check error
	2. The color of print message error
		New demo
	1. Add a data visualization demo(developing) 


1.0.7: Changed the whole structure of program
	1. Create a workspace to store the communication and functions of different interfaces by category
		* Ethernet Only Currently
	2. Create function root for ethernet:
		1. upgrade center(completed)
		2. data center(developing)
		3. command center(demo)
	2. Use main.py to run and test the program

1.0.8: Add data visualization function
	1. Show the updating wave plotting in the window (just support accels/gyros of imu currently)
	2. Fixed some bugs in data_captor, change the output mode of each function(on going)
	TODO:
	1. Add more infomation in data visualization(GNSS data next step)
	2. Add visualization function of the static data

1.0.9: New function
	1. Add a fuction that auto check whether data saving root exist, if not create the root
	2. Add a class to generate the csv file for the data saving
	3. Add a class for auto log parse data to the target csv file

1.1:  Fixed some bugs of program
	1. dm packet parse error
	2. lose packet in auto log parse data
	Optimized some functions
	1. optimized the build packet function, changed the way to add payload to packet, improve it universality
	2. add a new function to connect device (to solve the problem that dst/src address cant sync when the connect operation and get dst/src address not in the same class)

1.1.1: Add new function:
	1. Add Ntrip to enable GNSS data to obtain differential decomposition
	* Ntrip will be a thread proccess in program
	* it can be turned on or off anytime when program run
	Add two test sample in main.py
	1. INS401 connection speed test (PingTest)
	2. INS401 sampling time test (sample_time)

1.1.2: Add new function:
	1. Generate log file to record details during the upgrade
	2. Add a independent moudle to calculate CRC
	Optimized some functions
	1. Checked & modified the time delay in sdk part upgrade
	2. Add value return in read_until function

1.1.3: Add new function:
	1. Add command_center moudle to provide vehicle code function
	* vehicle code function amongs two parts: a. Write vcode & Read vcode; b. Set vcode & Get vcode
	2. Add command_center moudle to provide user command function (on going...)
	Fixed some bugs of program 
	1. Upgrade logger will lose some information when sdk part upgrade
	2. Fixed some communicate bugs
